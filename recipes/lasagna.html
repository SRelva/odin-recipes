    <h5>This is not <strong>lasagna</strong> because I'm too lazy to look it up, it's <small>pork</small></h5>

    I hope I'm doing this right, but this won't be lasagna, it's a pork something or other which I'll copy paste a description below into this.
    <p>Dress up pork tenderloins with colorful rainbow carrots, butternut squash, and red onion. Garnish with fresh herbs if you like. A green vegetable or salad completes the meal.

        <h4>How to cook, step by step</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or foil.</li>
        <li>Place 2 tablespoons olive oil, dates, vinegar, rosemary, garlic, salt, and pepper in a blender or small food processor. Pulse several times to mix, then puree until smooth, about 1 minute. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the mixture for later use.</li>
        <li>Combine rainbow carrots, butternut squash, and red onion in a large bowl. Toss with balsamic mixture, and place on the prepared sheet pan.</li>
        <li>Roast vegetables, uncovered in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, blot tenderloins with paper towels. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place tenderloins in skillet and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Stir vegetables; nestle tenderloins into vegetables. Brush each tenderloin with 1 tablespoon reserved balsamic mixture and return the sheet pan to the oven.</li>
        <li>Roast, uncovered, until vegetables are tender and pork is slightly pink in the center, about 20 minutes. The internal temperature of the meat should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Drizzle vegetables and tenderloins with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
        </ol>
